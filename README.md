# Portfolio

Code for my static GitHub Portfolio Page.

## How to use (Development Mode)

- Run `npm i`
- Run `num run compile:scss` to run SCSS changes watcher
- Open `index.html` using any live server
- Start to develop

NOTE: DON'T change the `/css/style.css` directly, only change styles in `/sass`


## How to use (Production Mode)
- After finishing the development phase
- Run `npm run build` to build the final files to be ready to be deployed.
